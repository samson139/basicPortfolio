      <h3>Sales Tax Calculator</h3>
      <p id="projExp">
        The provided HTML and JavaScript code form a web-based "Sales Tax
        Calculator" application. The HTML structure defines the layout of the
        web page, with input fields for entering the subtotal and tax rate,
        buttons for calculating and clearing, and spaces to display the
        calculated sales tax and total. The JavaScript code defines the
        application's functionality. Users can enter numeric values for the
        subtotal and tax rate, and the "Calculate" button validates the input
        and calculates the sales tax and total. The code performs checks to
        ensure that the input values are within valid ranges and displays
        appropriate alerts if not. It also allows users to clear the input
        fields with the "Clear" button. The styling is defined in an external
        CSS file, creating a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
        Overall, this project serves as a simple, user-friendly tool for
        calculating sales tax and total amounts based on user-provided values.

      <h3>Test Score Array</h3>
      <p id="projExp">
        The provided HTML and JavaScript code together create a web-based "Test
        Score Array" application. This application allows users to input names
        and their corresponding test scores. The HTML structure defines the
        layout of the web page, with fields for entering names and scores,
        buttons for adding data and displaying results, and a space for
        displaying the results and a table for viewing scores. It also links to
        an external stylesheet for styling and an external JavaScript file for
        functionality. The stylesheet defines the visual design of the page,
        including fonts, colors, and layout, creating a user-friendly interface.
        The JavaScript code defines the application's functionality. Users can
        input names and scores, and the "Add to Array" button validates the
        input and adds the data to arrays. The "Display Results" button
        calculates and displays the average test score and identifies the
        highest scorer. The "Display Scores" button populates a table with the
        entered data, showing names and corresponding scores. The code also
        includes error handling to ensure valid inputs, such as checking for
        empty or non-numeric score entries. Overall, this project is a simple
        web application that enables users to manage and analyze test scores
        using JavaScript arrays and provides a user interface for input and
        display of data.

      <h3>Survey</h3>
      <p id="projExp">
        The provided HTML document creates a simple "Complete a Form" web page
        with a survey form. The page uses a clean and organized layout with CSS
        styles for aesthetics. The form is divided into sections, each enclosed
        within a bordered div and starting with a heading. The first section
        collects "Contact information," including fields for the email address,
        first name, and last name. The email input has the "email" type,
        ensuring valid email format, while the first and last name fields are
        simple text inputs, all marked as "required." The second section
        captures "Geographic information" with fields for the state and zip
        code. The state field has a pattern attribute that enforces a
        two-character format, and the zip code field requires five digits. The
        third section inquires about "How did you hear from us?" and offers
        checkboxes for various options like web search, Facebook, Twitter, and
        email messages. At the end of the form, a "Submit" button allows users
        to submit their survey responses, and a "Reset" button clears the form
        for starting over. The page is styled with CSS, featuring a light blue
        background, defined font styles, and consistent coloring for labels and
        input fields. The overall design provides a user-friendly and visually
        appealing experience for completing the survey.

      <h3>Website</h3>
      <p id="projExp">
        The provided HTML document represents a webpage titled "The Alien
        Monster is Here," which appears to be dedicated to a fictional sci-fi
        game or story about alien invaders. The page includes essential elements
        such as a header with a title and a subheading, an image of the alien
        invaders, and a list of invaders categorized by seasons. Each invader in
        the list is linked to a related webpage. The main content of the page
        describes various ways for visitors to engage with the story or game,
        including purchasing a season pass to battle the invaders for a year or
        buying individual season invaders with the added bonus of extra
        spaceship skins. The footer section displays a copyright notice. The
        page uses CSS stylesheets for formatting and icon references. Overall,
        this project seems to be a promotional or informational website related
        to a fictional alien invasion theme, offering visitors options to
        explore or participate in the story/game.
